       "      <td>Eldora, Colorado is a small unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) located in southwestern Boulder County, Colorado, United States. The population of the community was 142 according to the United States Census Bureau's 2010 census. Eldora is primarily noted for its proximity to Eldora Mountain Resort, a popular destination for winter sports enthusiasts.\\n\\nGeography\\n\\nEldora is located in the Roosevelt National Forest, about three miles west of the town of Nederland and about 50 miles northwest of Denver. The community lies in a glacially sculpted valley surrounded by the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains. The Middle Boulder Creek flows through the heart of Eldora, adding to its picturesque appeal. The community is situated at an elevation of 8,700 feet.\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nEldora was originally established as a mining town in the late 19th century, during the Colorado Gold Rush, and was at one time a booming community with a population of several thousands of people. However, as the mines began to close, the population dwindled. The town was named after Eldora Slater, a local resident. \\n\\nToday, many of the original buildings, dating from as far back as 1897, can still be seen in Eldora, giving visitors a glimpse into the early days of the community. Other historical sites of interest include the restored Eldora Schoolhouse and the Eldora Cemetery.\\n\\nEconomy \\n\\nEldora's economy is mainly supported by the Eldora Mountain Resort, which provides both winter and summer outdoor recreation opportunities. The resort features numerous ski runs, cross-country skiing trails, and snowboarding areas. During the summer, the resort offers mountain biking, hiking, and scenic lift rides. \\n\\nAside from the mountain resort, other economic activities in Eldora include small-scale retail and service businesses catering to both residents and the influx of tourists during the winter months. These include lodging facilities, restaurants, and outdoor adventure services. However, many residents of Eldora commute to jobs in nearby towns, including Boulder and Denver.\\n\\nDemographics\\n\\nAccording to the 2010 Census Bureau's census, most of Eldora's population identifies as White, with a smaller percentage identifying as Hispanic or Latino. The median age in Eldora is 44 years old. Many of Eldora’s residents are married couples, many with children. \\n\\nEducation\\n\\nEldora falls under the Boulder Valley School District. However, due to its small population, the community does not have its own school. Most students travel to the neighboring</td>\n",

       "456322  Eldora, Colorado is a small unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) located in southwestern Boulder County, Colorado, United States. The population of the community was 142 according to the United States Census Bureau's 2010 census. Eldora is primarily noted for its proximity to Eldora Mountain Resort, a popular destination for winter sports enthusiasts.\\n\\nGeography\\n\\nEldora is located in the Roosevelt National Forest, about three miles west of the town of Nederland and about 50 miles northwest of Denver. The community lies in a glacially sculpted valley surrounded by the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains. The Middle Boulder Creek flows through the heart of Eldora, adding to its picturesque appeal. The community is situated at an elevation of 8,700 feet.\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nEldora was originally established as a mining town in the late 19th century, during the Colorado Gold Rush, and was at one time a booming community with a population of several thousands of people. However, as the mines began to close, the population dwindled. The town was named after Eldora Slater, a local resident. \\n\\nToday, many of the original buildings, dating from as far back as 1897, can still be seen in Eldora, giving visitors a glimpse into the early days of the community. Other historical sites of interest include the restored Eldora Schoolhouse and the Eldora Cemetery.\\n\\nEconomy \\n\\nEldora's economy is mainly supported by the Eldora Mountain Resort, which provides both winter and summer outdoor recreation opportunities. The resort features numerous ski runs, cross-country skiing trails, and snowboarding areas. During the summer, the resort offers mountain biking, hiking, and scenic lift rides. \\n\\nAside from the mountain resort, other economic activities in Eldora include small-scale retail and service businesses catering to both residents and the influx of tourists during the winter months. These include lodging facilities, restaurants, and outdoor adventure services. However, many residents of Eldora commute to jobs in nearby towns, including Boulder and Denver.\\n\\nDemographics\\n\\nAccording to the 2010 Census Bureau's census, most of Eldora's population identifies as White, with a smaller percentage identifying as Hispanic or Latino. The median age in Eldora is 44 years old. Many of Eldora’s residents are married couples, many with children. \\n\\nEducation\\n\\nEldora falls under the Boulder Valley School District. However, due to its small population, the community does not have its own school. Most students travel to the neighboring  "

      " The story centers on Charles, the husband of Alice, who is visiting his new estate. He insists that she stay in the chateau while he travels to Paris on business. Charles abruptly ends his trip and returns home, surprising Alice. He announces that he has sold the estate, and they will have to leave at once. Then he hands Alice a key he says he found on the path leading to the chateau.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice rejoices at the news of their departure, but is perplexed by the key. Charles vehemently tells her to discard it, but she cannot bring herself to throw it away. Later, while exploring the chateau, she discovers a room that is locked. Curiosity gets the better of her, and she tries the key. It fits! Alice is shocked to discover the room is full of blood-stained weapons and dead bodies. In a moment of madness, she realizes that Charles has killed his previous wives, and she must dispose of the key lest she become his next victim.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice returns the key to Charles and tells him it does not fit any of the doors. He is furious, but soon calms down. He insists that she search the room more thoroughly. Suddenly, Alice notices that the key has returned to its original spot—it has magically reappeared. Charles snatches it up and tells Alice that henceforth she will be locked in the room while he is away. Alice is terrified, but she seems to have no choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Charles leaves, Alice is haunted by the memory of the murdered wives. The bodies seem to come to life, and the ghosts plead with Alice to avenge their deaths. Soon, Alice fashions a noose and hanged herself from the peal of the bell tower, joining the other wives. Upon his return, Charles, who has genuinely loved Alice, is horrified by her death. He vows to never marry again, and spends the rest of his life alone and haunted by his victims.\n",
